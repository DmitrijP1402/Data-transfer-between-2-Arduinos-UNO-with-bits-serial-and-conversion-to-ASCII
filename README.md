# Data-transfer-between-2-Arduinos-UNO-with-bits-serial-and-conversion-to-ASCII
This repository contains an Arduino code implementation for serial communication with start bit transfer. The code allows communication between two Arduino boards using its own protocol. It contains two codes: one for receiving data and converting it to ASCII characters and another for transmitting ASCII characters (maximum 53 characters) by encoding them in bits and sending them with a start bit.
